A project for client where we were asked to develop the graph similar to those in pictures provided. 
Note that we were not provided any dataset or equations and we we were asked to plot the same graphs.
Also set the variables to control the peaks of the graph individually.

# Libraries Used
1 - Matplotlib
2 - Numpy
3 - Scipy
4 - Sklearn
The project was done using the different machine learning libraries including scipy, sklearn.
We used skLearn to plot the blobs around the location shown in the plot.
